## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[https://www.loom.com/share/b0c4f9c8b8f747ef88c4967e7e18168d as my gif walkthrough video]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Initially, my game was not playing any sound after following all the steps 1 through 7. I immediately figured it would be an issue with the JavaScript code because it 
had the AudioContext library where the sounds were to be generated from. I carefully went through all the code and found that the variable tonePlaying had initially been 
commented out but was being called in several other functions. The IDE was super helpful too since it had this small red button in places where a variable was being called
when it had not been initialized yet]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Web development seems to involve a lot on the back-end, is it possible for a developer to be well versed in both the frontend and the backend or everyone specializes in something specific?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would improve the User interface of the game to make it more interactive and appealing to the user. I would also add some nice color changing features to the start and end buttons, just for distinguishing them
and introduce a scoretracker to the game just so players can know exactly how well they did and also play against other players. I also plan on gradually building on this starting with the optional features. I literally heard about
this few hours to the deadline so I could not try my hands on the optional features but I really loved the experience and look forward to learning more on this stuff]
